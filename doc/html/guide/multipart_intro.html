<h1>Introduction to multipart</h1>

<p>Multipart originates from MIME, an Internet standard that extends the format of emails. Multipart messages are a container for parts of any content-type.</p>

<p>For example, a multipart message may have a part containing text and a second part containing an image. This is what allows you to attach files to emails.</p>

<p>In the context of HTTP, multipart is most often used with the <code>multipart/form-data</code> content-type. This is the content-type you have to use when you want browsers to be allowed to upload files through HTML forms.</p>

<p>Multipart is of course not required for uploading files, it is only required when you want to do so through HTML forms.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>A multipart message is a list of parts. Parts may contain either a multipart message or a non-multipart content-type. This allows parts to be arranged in a tree structure, although this is a rare case as far as the Web is concerned.</p>

<h2>Form-data</h2>

<p>In the normal case, when a form is submitted, the browser will use the <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> content-type. This type is just a list of keys and values and is therefore not fit for uploading files.</p>

<p>That's where the <code>multipart/form-data</code> content-type comes in. When the form is configured to use this content-type, the browser will use one part of the message for each form field. This means that a file input field will be sent in its own part, but the same applies to all other kinds of fields.</p>

<p>A form with a text input, a file input and a select choice box will result in a multipart message with three parts, one for each field.</p>

<p>The browser does its best to determine the content-type of the files it sends this way, but you should not rely on it for determining the contents of the file. Proper investigation of the contents is recommended.</p>
